# Twitch API Project for Free Code Camp

### [Demo](https://N8-B.github.io/twitch-api-project)

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install && npm start`
3. Visit `0.0.0.0:8080` in your browser

### TODO
- Fix background-image bug in Firefox and IE. Currently the Card Media component only works in Chrome. Giving a specific height to the image element, seems to fix the problem, but obviously negates the responsiveness.
